# Automated Exploratory Data Analysis
In this Project, I built an Automated EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tool using Python. This tool can preprocess and visualize data based on column types, simplifying the EDA process. It accepts data in various formats, including CSV and Excel databases, and automatically identifies data types for each column. The tool performs necessary preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and offers options for feature selection and dimensionality reduction, making it suitable for analyzing large datasets.
